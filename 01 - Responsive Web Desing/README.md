# Responsive Web Desing

### This is my Responsive Web Design Certification exercises, I learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

### I've practiced by building a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, I learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

### I effectively learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

### Thank you freeCodeCamp for providing me with an environment to practice and learn this course.
